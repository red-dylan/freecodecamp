  						<ul>
    						<li><strong>1856</strong> Born on July 10 to a Serbian Orthodox Priest in Smiljan, Austrian Empire.</li>
    						<li><strong>1873</strong> Graduates from Higher Real Gymnasium in Karlovac, completing 4 year term in three years.  Thought to be cheating because he could perform integral calculus in his head.</li>

							<li><strong>1875</strong> Enrolls in Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria on a Military Frontier scholarship.  Starts off as a very good student never missing a lecture, earning the highest grades possible and passing almost twice as many exams as required.</li>
							  
							<li><strong>1876</strong> Comes into conflict with Professor Poeschl, losses his scholarship, and becomes addicted to gambling. During the next year, Tesla loses his allowance and tuition money to gambling.  He is not prepared for the exam and leaves Austrian Polytechnic never graduating or receiving grades for the final semester.</li>

							<li><strong>1881</strong> Moves to Budapest to work under Ferenc Puskás at the Budapest Telephone Exchange. As chief electrician, Tesla makes many improvements to the equipment and claims to have perfected a telephone repeater, which has never been patented nor publicly described.</li>

							<li><strong>1882</strong> Moves to France to work for the Continental Edison Company where he designs and improves the electrical equipment.</li>

							<li><strong>1884</strong> Emigrates to New York City, USA, where he is hired by Thomas Edison at Edison Machine works.</li>

							<li><strong>1885</strong> Tasked with completely redesigning the Edison Company’s direct current generators.After months of work, Tesla resigns after a dispute with Edison over compensation.</li>

							<li><strong>1886</strong> Partners with two businessmen, Robert Lane and Benjamin Vail, who financed an electric company named Tesla Electric Light & Manufacturing.  Receives first patents in USA: arc light based systems and dynamo electric machine commutators.  Forced out of company without money or patents, which were assigned to the company.</li>

							<li><strong>1886</strong> Founding of the Tesla Electric Company with the financial backing of Alfred S. Brown and Charles Peck.</li>

							<li><strong>1887</strong> Develops an induction motor that runs on alternating current.  The motor uses a polyphase current which generates a rotating magnetic field to turn the motor.  The motor is patented a year later.</li>

							<li><strong>1888</strong> Brown and Peck negotiate a licensing deal with Westinghouse Electric & Manufacturing Company for Tesla’s induction motor.  Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year as a consultant at the company’s Pittsburgh lab.  In Pittsburgh, Tesla works on powering the streetcars with an AC motor. In the end, a DC motor is used because Tesla’s motor can only be run at a constant speed.</li>

							<li><strong>1891</strong> Becomes naturalized citizen of the United States. He builds two labs in New York City and lights lamps wirelessly at both locations.</li>

							<li><strong>1891</strong>  Patents the Tesla Coil.</li>

							<li><strong>1892</strong> Serves as the Vice President of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the forerunner of the IEEE, for 2 years.</li>

							<li><strong>1893</strong> Forms theories on the transmission by radio waves.</li>

							<li><strong>1894</strong> Begins investigating what he refers to as radiant energy of “invisible” kinds (later identified as X-rays) after finding film in his laboratory damaged by previous experiments.</li>

							<li><strong>1895</strong> Loses hundreds of invention models, plans, data, tools, and photographs in a laboratory fire.</li>

							<li><strong>1896</strong> Begins experimenting with X-ray imaging.</li>

							<li><strong>1898</strong> Demonstrates a radio controlled boat, which he called “teleautomaton” to the public during an electrical exhibition at Madison Square Garden.</li>

							<li><strong>1899</strong> Moves to Colorado Springs, Colorado so he could have room for his high-voltage and high-frequency electrical experiments.  There he investigates atmospheric electricity, producing artificial lightning with thunder that is reportedly heard 15 miles away.</li>

							<li><strong>1900</strong> Granted patents for a "system of transmitting electrical energy" and "an electrical transmitter."
							  
							  Begins planning the Wardenclyffe Tower facility, a trans-Atlantic wireless telecommunications facility.</li>

							<li><strong>1901</strong> Guglielmo Marconi successfully transmits the letter “S” from England to Newfoundland, beating Tesla to be the first to complete the trans-Atlantic transmission.</li>

							<li><strong>1902</strong> The Wardenclyffe Tower is erected.</li>

							<li><strong>1906</strong> Demonstrates his 200 horsepower 16,000 rpm bladeless turbine.</li>

							<li><strong>1912</strong> Believing that the application of electricity to the brain enhanced intelligence, creates a plan to “make dull students bright by saturating them unconsciously with electricity.”  His plan would wire the walls of a classroom saturating the room with electric waves.  Tesla believes this will create a health-giving and stimulating electric field within the classroom.</li>

							<li><strong>1916</strong>  Receives the Edison Medal, AIEE’s highest honor, "for meritorious achievement in his early original work in polyphase and high-frequency electrical currents."</li>

							<li><strong>1928</strong> Receives a patent for a biplane capable of taking off vertically and once in the air would gradually shift until flying like a conventional plane.  This would be Tesla’s last patent.</li>

							<li><strong>1935</strong> During an annual birthday celebration interview Tesla announces a method of accurately determining the location of underground mineral deposits.</li>

							<li><strong>1937</strong> At a luncheon in his honor, Tesla speaks of a “teleforce” weapon that would send concentrated beams of particles through the air.  Tesla believes this weapon would be so powerful that it would bring an end to war.  The press refers to this device as a “death ray.”</li>

							<li><strong>1943</strong> Tesla dies alone in his room at the Hotel New Yorker.  A medical examiner decides that Tesla’s death was caused by coronary thrombosis.  Over his lifetime Tesla had at least 278 patents issued to him in 26 different countries.</li>
